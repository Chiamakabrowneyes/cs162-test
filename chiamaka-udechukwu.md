Hey hey hey. Its Chiamakaa
My name is Chiamaka Obianuju Udechukwu.

Chiamaka means "God and his creations are beautiful".
Obianuju means "This child comes to this world with an abundance of beautiful things".
Udechukwu means "God's anointed".

I'm Nigerian, from the Igbo tribe. And my names tell the story of who I am.
